	   <h2> How it works </h2>
	   <p>We are creating a service where students can offer their tutoring services on a freelance basis and other students can browse proposed tutoring services and classes within their School. People will make a profile on the App and can sign up as wanting to get tutored or tutor others. Students who are offering tutoring services must apply and submit their qualifications via the form on the website and get approved as tutors.
